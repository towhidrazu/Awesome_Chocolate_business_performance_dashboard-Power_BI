In this project I developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI of a fictitious company named 'Awesome Chocolate' which sells chocolate products across the globe. 

Acknowledgement: The dataset used here was provided by chandoo.org under the competition.

Here based on requirement of CEO of Awesome Chocolate I developed some key matrics and useful visualizations to fullfill the requirements.

**Some features of the dashboard**
- Logo with 5 KPI Matrices long with Year To Date reference value:
		Matrices are: Total Sales, Total Profit, Profit% of sales, Boxes Sold, No. of Shipments
-	Title bar along with 4 slicers & a CLEAR button:
		Range of dates that covers this dashboard is mentioned under title.
		Total dashboard is interactive. Values can be dig down from aspects of Year, Region (also Country in 2nd level), Team and Category of products.
		A 'CLEAR' button is added to clear all filters and get dashboard back to original position for the ease of use.

- Chart 1: Area chart for Sales and Profit trend. Dates are hierarchical. Means drill-down to lower units (years to quarters to months) and drill-up to upper units (months to quarters to years) are possible.

-	Chart 2: Line chart for trend of box sold with 2 tooltips of nos. of shipment and low box (under 50) shipment. Dates are hierarchical. Means drill-down to lower units (years to quarters to months) and drill-up to upper units (months to quarters to years) are possible.

- Chart 3: Line chart for number of shipments with low boxes (under 50) shipment trend with tooltip of box sold. Dates are hierarchical. Means drill-down to lower units (years to quarters to months) and drill-up to upper units (months to quarters to years) are possible.

- Chart 4: A bar chart to understand product level performance with no. of products selecting slider.

- Chart 5: A table with data bar in YTD sales and sparkline of sales performance over time to understand salespersons level	performance.
